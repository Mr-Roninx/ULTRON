# ULTRON-AGENT Causal Experiments & Benchmarks

## 1. Experimental Methodology
ULTRON-AGENT undergoes paired causal benchmarking across five controlled configurations:
1. `DETERMINISTIC_BASELINE`: Pure deterministic scoring and market allocation.
2. `LLM_ONLY`: LLM intent without tools or memory.
3. `LLM_WITH_TOOLS`: LLM + 18 bounded tools.
4. `LLM_WITH_MEMORY`: LLM + tools + working/episodic memory.
5. `FULL_AGENT`: Complete agent with dynamic assumption validation and replanning.
